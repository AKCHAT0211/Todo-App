Introduction:
I have created a simple To Do application using the Django Framework in which the frontend is observed as the login page, registration page performing User Authentication tasks and the To do list showing the completed and incompleted tasks to the users. 
There is also a search functionality  which helps users to search their tasks in a fastest and efficient way.
